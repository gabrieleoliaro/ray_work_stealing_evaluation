# ray_work_stealing_evaluation

This repository contains the following files:

1. `execute_tasks.py`: This script allows you to run a workload that consists of the execution of a series of Ray tasks. The script's arguments allow you to customize **the total sequential duration** of the experiment (i.e. the time a single-core Ray worker should take to execute all tasks in a sequential fashion), **the individual task duration** (i.e. the length of each task, taken individually), **the number of cores** to use in the experiment, the **maximum number of tasks in flight to any worker**, whether **work stealing** is to be enabled, and the **path to the output file**, where the raw data will be placed
2. `run_experiment.sh`: This script allows you to run an experiment that consists of multiple jobs, where each job is completed by running the `execute_tasks.py` script with the proper arguments. All the parameters for the experiment are defined at the top of the files. Edit those values to customize your experiment. In particular, the script allows you to choose: the **number of trials** to use for each job in the experiment, the set of values to test for the **maximum number of tasks in flight to any worker** (one per job), the **the total sequential duration** (same for all the jobs) and the **the individual task duration** (one for each job). The script will run one job for each combination of the parameters, and repeat the experiment with **work stealing** enabled and without.
